Ariadne is an intelligent quantum circuit routing system that automatically analyzes circuit properties and selects the optimal simulator backend. By leveraging mathematical analysis of circuit structure (entropy, treewidth, Clifford ratio), Ariadne delivers significant productivity improvements over manual backend selection.

The routing system is designed for transparency and determinism - every routing decision is based on measurable circuit characteristics and can be audited for correctness.

## üéØ The Ariadne Advantage: Intelligent Automation

Ariadne's core innovation is its ability to mathematically analyze a circuit's structure to determine the optimal execution environment. This eliminates the need for quantum developers to manually select backends based on circuit characteristics.

### Specialized Routing for Maximum Efficiency

    A[Input Circuit] --> B{Circuit Analysis};
    B --> C{Pure Clifford?};
    C -- YES --> D[Stim Backend];
    C -- NO --> E{Low Entanglement?};
    E -- YES --> F[MPS Backend];
    E -- NO --> G{Hardware Available?};
    G -- Apple Silicon --> H[Metal Backend];
    G -- NVIDIA GPU --> I[CUDA Backend];
    G -- None --> J[CPU Backend];
    D --> K["Optimal Result"];
    F --> K;
    H --> K;
    I --> K;
    J --> K;
```

### Transparent Decision Making

Ariadne provides complete transparency into why a circuit was routed to a specific backend:

```python
from ariadne import QuantumRouter

router = QuantumRouter()
decision = router.select_optimal_backend(your_circuit)
print(f"Recommended backend: {decision.recommended_backend}")
print(f"Circuit entropy: {decision.circuit_entropy:.3f}")
print(f"Reasoning: {decision.reasoning}")
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

**Quick Install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shannon-Labs/ariadne.git
cd ariadne
pip install -e .
```

**With Hardware Acceleration:**
```bash
# Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
pip install -e .[apple]

# NVIDIA GPU (CUDA)
pip install -e .[cuda]

# All optional dependencies
pip install -e .[apple,cuda,viz]
```

üìñ **For detailed installation instructions, see the [Comprehensive Installation Guide](docs/comprehensive_installation.md)**

### Your First Simulation

Ariadne automatically routes your circuit to the optimal simulator without any code changes.

```python
from ariadne import simulate
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

# Create any circuit - let Ariadne handle the rest
qc = QuantumCircuit(20, 20)
qc.h(range(10))
for i in range(9):
    qc.cx(i, i + 1)
qc.measure_all()

# One simple call that handles all backend complexity
result = simulate(qc, shots=1000)
print(f"Backend used: {result.backend_used}")
print(f"Execution time: {result.execution_time:.4f}s")
print(f"Unique outcomes: {len(result.counts)}")
```

### Quickstart Demo

Run the complete quickstart example to see Ariadne in action:

```bash
python examples/quickstart.py
```

This demo showcases:
- Automatic backend selection for different circuit types
- Performance comparisons
- Routing decision transparency
- Hardware acceleration when available

## üìä Performance

Ariadne's primary value is not raw speed, but **intelligent routing** and **developer productivity**. By automatically selecting the best backend for a given circuit, Ariadne saves developers from having to manually manage different simulation environments.

While Ariadne can provide significant speedups in certain scenarios (e.g., using the Stim backend for large Clifford circuits), the overhead of circuit analysis means that for small circuits, direct simulation with a specific backend may be faster.

The true advantage of Ariadne is its ability to **extend your capabilities** by seamlessly routing circuits to backends that can handle them, such as simulating very large Clifford circuits with Stim, which would be impossible with a standard statevector simulator.

For detailed, up-to-date performance data, please refer to the benchmark reports in the `benchmarks/results` directory.

## üîß Usage Examples

### Automatic Detection of Specialized Circuits

Ariadne recognizes when circuits can benefit from specialized simulators like Stim.

```python
from ariadne import simulate
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

# Large Clifford circuit that would crash plain Qiskit
qc = QuantumCircuit(40, 40)
qc.h(0)
for i in range(39):
    qc.cx(i, i + 1)  # Creates a 40-qubit GHZ state
qc.measure_all()

# Ariadne automatically routes to Stim for optimal performance
result = simulate(qc, shots=1000)
print(f"Backend used: {result.backend_used}")  # -> stim
```

### Inspecting Routing Decisions

```python
from ariadne import QuantumRouter

router = QuantumRouter()
decision = router.select_optimal_backend(your_circuit)

print(f"Analysis Results:")
print(f"  Recommended: {decision.recommended_backend}")
print(f"  Confidence: {decision.confidence_score:.2f}")
print(f"  Entropy: {decision.circuit_entropy:.3f}")
print(f"  Reasoning: {decision.reasoning}")
```
