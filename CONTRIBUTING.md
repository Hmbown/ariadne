## How to Contribute

### Submitting Issues

Before creating a new issue:

- **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
- **Check the documentation** to see if your question is already answered

When submitting an issue, please include:

- **Clear title and description**
- **Steps to reproduce** (for bugs)
- **Expected vs actual behavior**
- **Environment details** (OS, Python version, Ariadne version)
- **Code snippets** or error messages (use code blocks)
- **Screenshots** if applicable

**Issue Templates:**
- Bug Report: For reporting bugs or errors
- Feature Request: For suggesting new features
- Documentation: For documentation improvements
- Question: For general questions

---

## Submitting Pull Requests

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing PRs** to avoid duplicate work
2. **Open an issue first** for major changes to discuss the approach
3. **Review architectural decisions** in [`docs/router_decisions.md`](docs/router_decisions.md) for routing/core logic changes

### PR Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow existing code patterns
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes:**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   pytest

   # Run specific tests
   pytest tests/test_specific.py

   # Check code coverage
   pytest --cov=ariadne tests/
   ```

4. **Lint your code:**
   ```bash
   # Ruff will run automatically via pre-commit
   # Or run manually:
   ruff check .
   ruff format .
   ```

5. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
   ```

   **Commit Message Guidelines:**
   - Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
   - Limit first line to 72 characters
   - Reference issues and pull requests when applicable

6. **Push to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Provide a clear title and description
   - Link related issues
   - Describe what changed and why
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - List any breaking changes

---

## Code Style Guidelines

Ariadne uses automated tools to enforce code style:

- **Formatter**: `ruff format` (runs via pre-commit)
- **Linter**: `ruff check` (runs via pre-commit)
- **Type Checker**: `mypy` (optional but recommended)

### Key Style Points

- **Line length**: 120 characters maximum
- **Imports**: Organized automatically by ruff
- **Naming conventions**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions/variables: `snake_case`
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings
- **Type hints**: Add type hints to all public functions

### Example Docstring

```python
def simulate(circuit: QuantumCircuit, shots: int = 1024) -> SimulationResult:
    """Simulate a quantum circuit with automatic backend selection.

    Args:
        circuit: The quantum circuit to simulate.
        shots: Number of measurement shots to perform.

    Returns:
        SimulationResult containing counts, backend used, and execution time.

    Raises:
        CircuitTooLargeError: If the circuit exceeds available resources.
        SimulationError: If the simulation fails.
    """
```

## Testing Requirements

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=ariadne

# Run specific test categories
pytest -m unit          # Unit tests only
pytest -m integration   # Integration tests only
pytest -m "not slow"    # Skip slow tests
```

### Writing Tests

- **Location**: Place tests in `tests/` directory
- **Naming**: Test files must start with `test_`
- **Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage for new code
- **Markers**: Use pytest markers for test categorization

```python
import pytest
from ariadne import simulate

def test_basic_simulation():
    """Test basic circuit simulation."""
    # Arrange
    circuit = create_bell_circuit()

    # Act
    result = simulate(circuit, shots=1000)

    # Assert
    assert result.backend_used in ['qiskit', 'stim']
    assert len(result.counts) > 0
```

## Documentation

### Types of Documentation

1. **Code Documentation**: Docstrings in source code
2. **User Documentation**: Markdown files in `docs/`
3. **Examples**: Python scripts in `examples/`
4. **API Reference**: Auto-generated from docstrings

### Updating Documentation

When making changes, update:

- **Docstrings**: For API changes
- **README.md**: For major features
- **USER_GUIDE.md**: For user-facing functionality
- **Examples**: Add or update example scripts
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Document changes for next release

---

## Community

### Getting Help

- **GitHub Discussions**: For questions and discussions
- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports and feature requests
- **Documentation**: Start with [README.md](README.md) and [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md)

### Code Review Process

All PRs require:

1. **Passing CI/CD checks** (tests, linting, type checking)
2. **Code review** from at least one maintainer
3. **Documentation updates** if applicable
4. **CHANGELOG entry** for user-facing changes

### Recognition

Contributors are recognized in:

- **CHANGELOG.md**: For each release
- **GitHub Contributors**: Automatically tracked
- **Release Notes**: For significant contributions
