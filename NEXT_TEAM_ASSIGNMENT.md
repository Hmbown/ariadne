# üéØ NEXT TEAM ASSIGNMENT: Complete Professional Polish

## MISSION
Transform Ariadne from "functional" to "truly professional" by addressing all remaining quality issues. This is about credibility and trust - users must be able to rely on every claim we make.

---

## üö® PRIORITY 1: ELIMINATE ALL FAILING TESTS (MANDATORY)

### Task: Fix or Document All 19 Failing Tests

**Current State:** 275 tests pass, 19 fail (primarily test_config_coverage.py and test_config_realistic.py)

**Action Required:**
1. Run `python3 -m pytest tests/test_config_coverage.py -v` to see specific failures
2. For each failing test:
   - **If the feature should work:** Fix the bug causing the failure
   - **If the feature isn't implemented:** Mark test as `@pytest.mark.skip` with clear reason
   - **If test is invalid:** Delete or fix the test

**Success Criteria:**
- `python3 -m pytest tests/ --tb=no -q` shows: `==== 294 passed, 0 failed ====`
- OR: Clearly documented skipped tests with explanations

---

## üö® PRIORITY 2: PURGE ALL TODO/FIXME/NOTIMPLEMENTED (MANDATORY)

### Task: Clean Production Code of Incomplete Items

**Current State:** Multiple files have TODOs, FIXMEs, and NotImplementedError

**Action Required:**
1. Find all TODO/FIXME/NotImplementedError:
   ```bash
   grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|NotImplementedError" /Users/huntermbown/ariadne/src/ariadne/ --include="*.py"
   ```

2. For each found:
   - **If in experimental backend:** Delete the file OR implement it
   - **If in production feature:** Implement it immediately
   - **If in private/internal code:** Move to issue tracker, remove from code

**Specifically address:**
- `/experimental/` backends: PyQuil, Braket, Q#, OpenCL, Intel QS - these should either be fully implemented or removed
- `metal_backend_stub.py` - should be implemented or deleted
- Any `NotImplementedError` in actual code paths

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero TODO/FIXME/NotImplementedError in entire codebase
- Either implemented or deleted - no middle ground

---

## üö® PRIORITY 3: ENFORCE 100% TYPE SAFETY (MANDATORY)

### Task: Make mypy Pass Without Errors

**Current State:** mypy ignores many modules per pyproject.toml configuration

**Action Required:**
1. Remove mypy `ignore_errors = true` overrides in pyproject.toml
2. Run `mypy src/ariadne/` to see real type errors
3. Fix all type errors by:
   - Adding proper type hints to all functions
   - Fixing any import issues
   - Ensuring consistency

**Success Criteria:**
- `mypy src/ariadne/` exits with code 0 (no errors)
- All functions have proper type hints
- No `type: ignore` comments except where absolutely necessary

---

## üö® PRIORITY 4: ENFORCE 100% CODE QUALITY (MANDATORY)

### Task: Fix All Linting Issues

**Action Required:**
1. Run `ruff check src/ tests/` to see all linting errors
2. Fix ALL linting errors (except documented ignore rules in pyproject.toml)
3. Run `ruff format src/ tests/` to fix formatting
4. Ensure CI linting step passes

**Success Criteria:**
- `ruff check src/ tests/` exits with code 0
- `ruff format --check src/ tests/` passes (no formatting changes needed)

---

## üö® PRIORITY 5: CLEAR EXPERIMENTAL VS PRODUCTION (MANDATORY)

### Task: Demarcate Feature Readiness

**Action Required:**
1. Review all backends and mark them as:
   - ‚úÖ **Production-Ready:** Stim, MPS, Tensor Networks, Qiskit
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Experimental:** JAX-Metal, CUDA (if partially working)
   - ‚ùå **Remove:** Any backend that's just a stub

2. Update README.md:
   - Remove "experimental" badges from features we actually support
   - Add clear version numbers for when features became stable
   - Move experimental features to separate section at bottom

**Success Criteria:**
- User can clearly see what's safe to use in production
- No ambiguity about feature status

---

## üö® PRIORITY 6: VERIFY ALL EXAMPLES WORK (MANDATORY)

### Task: Make Every Example Actually Run

**Action Required:**
1. Test every example in `examples/` directory:
   ```bash
   for file in examples/*.py; do
     echo "Testing $file..."
     python3 "$file" || echo "FAILED: $file"
   done
   ```

2. Test every notebook:
   ```bash
   for nb in examples/*.ipynb; do
     jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute "$nb" --stdout
   done
   ```

3. Fix any examples that fail

**Success Criteria:**
- Every example runs successfully
- Every notebook executes without errors
- Output matches documented behavior

---

## üö® PRIORITY 7: STRENGTHEN ERROR HANDLING (HIGH)

### Task: Ensure Graceful Failures

**Action Required:**
1. Review all public API functions
2. Ensure they raise helpful errors for:
   - Invalid inputs
   - Missing dependencies
   - Unsupported operations

3. Users should never see raw stack traces for expected errors

**Example:**
```python
# GOOD:
raise BackendUnavailableError(
    "cuda",
    "CUDA backend not available. Install cupy-cuda12x to enable GPU acceleration."
)

# BAD:
raise ImportError("No module named 'cupy'")
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All error messages are user-friendly
- Stack traces only for actual bugs, not user errors

---

## üö® PRIORITY 8: DOCUMENT API BOUNDARIES (HIGH)

### Task: Make Public API Clear

**Action Required:**
1. Review `src/ariadne/__init__.py`
2. Ensure every public API:
   - Has proper docstring
   - Is listed in `__all__`
   - Has type hints
   - Has usage example if complex

3. Add `@api_stable` or `@api_experimental` decorators if helpful

**Success Criteria:**
- Users can easily identify what's part of stable API
- Each public function has clear documentation

---

## üö® PRIORITY 9: VALIDATE AGAINST REAL WORLD (MEDIUM)

### Task: Test with Real Use Cases

**Action Required:**
1. Create 5-10 realistic quantum circuit examples
2. Ensure Ariadne handles them correctly
3. Document actual performance on these examples

**Success Criteria:**
- Real-world circuits work smoothly
- Performance matches expectations
- No unexpected crashes or errors

---

## üö® PRIORITY 10: FINAL QUALITY GATES (CRITICAL)

### Task: Run Full Quality Checklist

**Before marking complete, verify:**

‚úÖ **Tests:** `pytest tests/` ‚Üí 100% pass rate
‚úÖ **Types:** `mypy src/ariadne/` ‚Üí 0 errors
‚úÖ **Linting:** `ruff check src/ tests/` ‚Üí 0 errors
‚úÖ **Examples:** All examples run successfully
‚úÖ **TODOs:** Zero TODO/FIXME/NotImplementedError
‚úÖ **Docs:** Every documented feature works
‚úÖ **Benchmarks:** All benchmark tests pass
‚úÖ **Error Handling:** Graceful failures everywhere
‚úÖ **Type Hints:** Complete coverage
‚úÖ **README:** Claims match reality
‚úÖ **Notebooks:** All execute successfully
