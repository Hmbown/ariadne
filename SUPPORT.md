# Support

Ariadne is an open source project maintained by the community. This document describes where to get help and how we handle support requests in a predictable, professional way.

- Questions and usage help: open a GitHub Discussion or check the documentation in `docs/`
- Bugs and feature requests: open an issue using the templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- Security reports: follow the process in `SECURITY.md` (do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities)
- Professional services: not provided; please open a Discussion if you’re interested in collaboration

## Response Expectations

- Issues are triaged on a best‑effort basis
- Reproducible reports with minimal examples are prioritized
- Security disclosures receive priority per `SECURITY.md`

## Version Support Policy

See `docs/project/RELEASE_MANAGEMENT.md` for our release cadence and support policy. In short:
- Latest minor: active development and bug fixes
- Previous minor: security fixes and critical regressions only
- LTS (if designated): per release notes

## Communication Guidelines

Be respectful and follow the project `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`. Provide environment details (OS, Python, package versions) and steps to reproduce when reporting issues.
