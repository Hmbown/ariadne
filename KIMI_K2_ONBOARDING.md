### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues Before Launch
1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: 2 Dependabot alerts (1 critical, 1 high) - MUST be addressed
2. Review GitHub Security tab: https://github.com/Hmbown/ariadne/security/dependabot

## üöÄ Your Mission: Pre-Launch Excellence

### Phase 1: Security & Stability (CRITICAL)
1. **Fix Dependabot Vulnerabilities**
   - Navigate to GitHub Security/Dependabot alerts
   - Update vulnerable dependencies
   - Test thoroughly after each update
   - Ensure CI/CD passes

2. **Dependency Audit**
   - Run: `make lint` and ensure all checks pass
   - Verify Docker builds: `docker-compose build`
   - Test cross-platform compatibility (the CI does Ubuntu/macOS/Windows)

### Phase 2: Launch Readiness Assessment
1. **Documentation Review**
   - Ensure README.md is compelling and accurate
   - Verify all code examples work
   - Check CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
   - Update CHANGELOG.md if needed

2. **Testing Coverage**
   - Run full test suite: `make test`
   - Check benchmarks: `cd benchmarks && python run_all_benchmarks.py`
   - Validate examples: `python examples/validate_readme_examples.py`

3. **Performance Validation**
   - Verify CUDA backend works (if GPU available)
   - Verify Metal backend on Apple Silicon
   - Run reproducible benchmarks
   - Check memory efficiency for large circuits

## üí° Philosophy & Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Users should get great results with minimal code
2. **Transparency**: Always explain why a backend was chosen
3. **Performance**: Speed matters, but correctness comes first
4. **Education**: Make quantum computing accessible
5. **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade reliability

## ü§ù Collaboration Notes
