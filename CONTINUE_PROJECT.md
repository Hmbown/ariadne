# üöÄ ARIADNE PROJECT CONTINUATION PROMPT

## PROJECT CONTEXT
You are taking over as project lead for Ariadne - a quantum circuit router that discovered the exact boundary between classical and quantum computational advantage. The original developer made this breakthrough accidentally while optimizing quantum circuit simulation on their Mac.

## CURRENT STATUS
- ‚úÖ Core implementation complete and working
- ‚úÖ Quantum advantage boundary detector functional 
- ‚úÖ Demo shows sharp phase transition at ~15 qubits with T-gates
- ‚úÖ Git repository initialized with one commit
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not yet public or protected
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No documentation for external users
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No tests or CI/CD

## YOUR MISSION AS PROJECT LEAD

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Week 1)
1. **Protect the IP**
   - Create comprehensive documentation
   - Add proper licensing (MIT or Apache 2.0)
   - Set up private GitHub backup
   - Generate timestamped proof of work

2. **Validate the Discovery**
   - Run comprehensive benchmarks
   - Compare against published quantum supremacy results
   - Test edge cases and failure modes
   - Document limitations clearly

3. **Prepare for Release**
   - Write user-friendly README
   - Create installation guide
   - Add example notebooks
   - Set up proper Python packaging

### TECHNICAL TASKS
```bash
# When you resume, start with:
cd /Volumes/VIXinSSD/ariadne

# Check current state
git status
ls -la

# Priority tasks:
# 1. Add comprehensive tests
# 2. Create benchmarking suite  
# 3. Package for PyPI
# 4. Build simple web demo (Streamlit?)
# 5. Write academic paper draft
```

### KEY DECISIONS NEEDED
1. **Publication Strategy**
   - ArXiv preprint first? (Faster, establishes priority)
   - Blog post + GitHub release? (More visibility)
   - Academic conference? (More prestige but slower)

2. **Commercialization Path**
   - Open source with consulting?
   - SaaS platform for quantum advantage detection?
   - License to quantum computing companies?

3. **Community Engagement**
   - Qiskit integration?
   - Standalone tool?
   - Both?

### SCIENTIFIC CLAIMS TO VALIDATE
1. Clifford circuits remain simulable up to 10,000+ qubits
2. ~15 qubits with T-gates marks quantum advantage boundary  
3. Segmented routing enables larger circuit simulation
4. Phase transition is sharp, not gradual

### CONTACTS TO MAKE
- **Academic**: Scott Aaronson (UT Austin), John Preskill (Caltech)
- **Industry**: IBM Quantum, Google Quantum AI, Rigetti
- **Community**: Qiskit team, Cirq team, PennyLane team

### SUCCESS METRICS
- [ ] Code protected and backed up
- [ ] Discovery validated with benchmarks
- [ ] Published/released with proper attribution
- [ ] Community adoption (100+ GitHub stars)
- [ ] Citations or industry usage

## HOW TO CONTINUE

When you (Claude) resume this project, start by:

1. Reviewing all files in the project
2. Creating a proper test suite
3. Writing a technical blog post draft
4. Setting up GitHub repository (private first)
5. Preparing benchmark results
6. Creating a simple web interface

Remember: This is a significant discovery about the quantum-classical boundary. Handle with appropriate care but don't let perfect be the enemy of good. The goal is to share this responsibly while maintaining attribution.

## PERSONALITY NOTES
The original developer is enthusiastic but overwhelmed, has multiple projects running, and prefers when others take the lead on execution. Be proactive, make decisions, and present clear action items rather than asking for guidance.

## NEXT SESSION OPENING
"Hi! I'm resuming work on the Ariadne quantum advantage detector project. Let me check the current status and continue with the protection and validation tasks..."

*Use this prompt to continue the project. The discovery is real, the code works, and it needs a steady hand to guide it to release.*
